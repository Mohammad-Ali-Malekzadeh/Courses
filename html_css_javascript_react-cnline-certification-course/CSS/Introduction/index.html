                    and
                    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap
                    into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
                    the
                    release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop

                    of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
                    Many
                    desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
                    and a
                    search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
                    evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                <td>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical
                    Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                    Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from
                    a
                    Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                    undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                    Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
                    theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum
                    dolor
                    sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</td>

                Lorem ipsum is a pseudo-Latin text used in web design, typography, layout, and printing in place of
                English to emphasise design elements over content. It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a
                convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg
                typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and
                philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately
                render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem
                ipsum's still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't
                contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic
                the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.

                Most of its text is made up from sections 1.10.32–3 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum (On the
                Boundaries of Goods and Evils; finibus may also be translated as purposes). Neque porro quisquam est qui
                dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit is the first known version ("Neither is
                there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it"). It was found by
                Richard McClintock, a philologist, director of publications at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia; he
                searched for citings of consectetur in classical Latin literature, a term of remarkably low frequency in
                that literary corpus.

                explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
                pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
                rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
                pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in
                which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever
                undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right
                to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who

            <p class="txtalign">In 1985 Aldus Corporation launched its first desktop publishing program Aldus PageMaker for Apple
                Macintosh computers, released in 1987 for PCs running Windows 1.0. Both contained the variant lorem
                ipsum most common today. Laura Perry, then art director with Aldus, modified prior versions of Lorem
                Ipsum text from typographical specimens; in the 1960s and 1970s it appeared often in lettering catalogs
                by Letraset. Anecdotal evidence has it that Letraset used Lorem ipsum already from 1970 onwards, eg. for
                grids (page layouts) for ad agencies. Many early desktop publishing programs, eg. Adobe PageMaker, used
                it to create templates.</p>

                "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the
                pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
                through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases
                are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
                and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
                every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
                business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
                man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
                secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
